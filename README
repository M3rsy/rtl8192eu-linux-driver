Compile errors eliminated for kernels 4.3-rc6 (and 4.2.4). Corrected?? 
/data/rtl892eu-4.x/include/rtw_debug.h:187:19: error: void value not ignored as it ought to be
#define seqdump seq_printf
^
/data/rtl892eu-4.x/include/rtw_debug.h:240:7: note: in expansion of macro ‘_seqdump’
if(_seqdump(sel, fmt, ##arg)) /rtw_warn_on(1)/; \
^
seq_printf returns void, if statement can't handle void, I eliminated if and a set of parens.
Correct?? Don't know. Does driver work? Don't know, don't have an rtl8192eu dongle. Please speak
up if you know.  

DKMS
